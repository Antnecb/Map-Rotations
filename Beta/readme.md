**Dynamic Rotations**
-
>Thanks to our wonderful Jr. Dev javipepe, we now have dynamic rotations! What this means is that the rot will change depending on how many players are online. No longer will maps be too big or too small for the playercount! This is our current setup for the dynamic rotations:

- Mini: 8v8 - 14v14
- Medium: 15v15 - 24v24 (activates when 28 players are online, deactivates when less than 28 online)
- Mega: 25v25+ (activates when 46 players are online, deactivates when less than 46 are online)
