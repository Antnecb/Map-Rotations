# Beta

Beta is currently the only public server on the Stratus Network, so it's rotation needs to be abe to host a multitude of gamemodes and match sizes to suit all players and playstyles. Take this into account when you suggest changes, as maps that are below 12v12 and above 30v30 will most likely not be loaded into the rotation, but retained for casual events and /setnexts
