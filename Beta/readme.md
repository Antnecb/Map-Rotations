# Beta

>Beta is currently the only public server on the Stratus Network, so it's rotation needs to be able to host a multitude of gamemodes and match sizes to suit all players and playstyles. 

**Dynamic Rotations**
-
>Dynamic rotations are dynamic in the sense that the rot will change depending on how many players are online. This fixes the problem that maps will be too big or too small for the player count. This is our current setup for the dynamic rotations:

- Mini: <16v16
- Medium: 26v26
- Mega: >26v26
