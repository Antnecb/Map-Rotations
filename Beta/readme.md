# Beta Server

Beta is currently the only server available on the Stratus Network, so the rotation is mixed between multiple gamemodes and map sizes.

## Contributing
- If there is a **map** or **XML** error, create an **[Issue](https://github.com/StratusNetwork/Map-Rotations/issues)**
- If you would like to add/remove **less than 5 maps**, create an **[Issue](https://github.com/StratusNetwork/Map-Rotations/issues)**
- If you would like to add/remove **more than 5 maps**, create a **[Pull Request](https://github.com/StratusNetwork/Map-Rotations/pulls)**

## Submitting a New Map
- Create an **[Issue](https://github.com/StratusNetwork/Map-Rotations/issues)** titled with the **name of your map** and inside, provide:
 - A link to an album of screenshots (preferably imgur)
 - A **[Packaged Download](http://docs.oc.tc/guides/packaging/cleaning_files)** (If you would like your map to remain private, skip this step)
 - Your **Discord** username and tag, for a Map Developer to get in contact with you. Example: `name#1234`
